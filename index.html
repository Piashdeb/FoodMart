            <p>“We ought to be about something beyond moving chicken. We ought to be a piece of our clients’ lives and
                the networks in which we serve.” <br>

                Our originator, settled on the choice to close on Sundays in 1946 when he opened his first eatery in
                Hapeville, Georgia. Having worked seven days seven days in eateries open 24 hours, Truett saw the
                significance of shutting on Sundays with the goal that he and his representatives could set aside one
                day to rest and love whether they pick – a training we maintain today.

            <h3>Coffee </h3>
            <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea
                species. All fruit must be further processed from a raw material—the fruit and seed—into a stable, raw
                product; un-roasted, green coffee. To process the berries, the seed is separated from the fruit to
                produce green coffee. Green coffee is then roasted, a process which transforms the raw product (green
                coffee) into a consumable product (roasted coffee). Roasted coffee is ground into a powder and mixed
                with water to produce a cup of coffee.</p>

            <h3>Pizza</h3>
            <p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is an Italian dish consisting of a usually round,
                flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other
                ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked
                at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a
                pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>

            <h3>Hamburger</h3>
            <p>A hamburger (also burger for short) is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or more
                cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be
                pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato,
                onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special
                sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A
                hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p>
